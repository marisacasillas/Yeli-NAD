There are /s/ sounds used in near-child speech in all 10 kids I've got transcripts for. Nearly all of them are direct borrowings from English or are borrowings from Tok Pisin, which is an English-based pidgin.

The list of found words with 's' is below. I searched for s and z sounds spelled with 's', so this list may underestimate English borrowings with 'ci' etc. Finally, I didn't carefully monitor for word repeats within child.
