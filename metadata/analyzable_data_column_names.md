# all.analyzable.data.csv column names
- **experiment** = experiment; 1 (real/rule words vs. part words) or 2 (real/rule words vs. phantom words)
- **version** = language version; 1–4 (see stimuli/NAD_field.xlsx for details)
- **participant** = participant number; 1–41 (see logfiles/trials for original files)
- **item.pair** = letter indicating the pair of test items; there are 18 test pairs per experiment, so pairs are A–R (see stimuli/word_files.csv for details)
- **correct.bin** = whether the response is correct or not; 1 (correct) or 0 (incorrect)
- **pair.order** = the order in which the test stimuli were presented; foil-true or true-foil
- **response.type** = what response was given—used to create `correct.bin` above; true (correct) or foil (incorrect)
- **response.num** = which button was selected for the response; 1 (the button marked '1') or 2 (the button marked '2')
- **response.dur** = the number of seconds elapsed between the end of the second test stimulus and the onset of response (i.e., the reaction time)
- **response.start** = the number of seconds into the experiment when the participant gave the response
- **true.dur** = the duration in seconds of the 'true' test stimulus
- **true.start** = the number of seconds into the experiment when the 'true' stimulus started to play
- **foil.dur** = the duration in seconds of the 'foil' test stimulus
- **foil.start** = the number of seconds into the experiment when the 'foil' stimulus started to play
- **true.type** = the type of 'true' word; real word or rule word
- **true.structure** = the structural type of 'true' word (only one type); AXB
- **true.pos1** = which syllable appeared in position 1 of the true word
- **true.pos2** = which syllable appeared in position 2 o the true word
- **true.pos3** = which syllable appeared in position 2 o the true word
- **true.RFname** = the RF-style file name for the true word showing which syllables are concatenated to create the word (in the experiment we use file names that instead only include the pair name and whether the word is true or foil because of the way the tablet software is set up)
- **phase** = whether the test pair is for segmentation or generalization; segmentation or generalization
- **foil.type** = the type of 'foil' word; partword, or phantomword, or phantomruleword
- **foil.structure** = the structural type of 'foil' word; CAX, XCA, NCA, XNA, CAN, or AXB
- **foil.pos1** = which syllable appeared in position 1 of the foil word
- **foil.pos2** = which syllable appeared in position 2 o the foil word
- **foil.pos3** = which syllable appeared in position 2 o the foil word
- **foil.RFname** = the RF-style file name for the foil word (see `true.RFname ` above for explanation)
- **language_mother** = the native language of the participant's mother
- **language_father** = the native language of the participant's father
- **age** = the participant's self-reported age in years
- **sex** = the participant's gender; M (male) or F (female)
- **grade** = the number of education years completed by the participant
- **notes** = notes left by the experimenter (ST) about testing
- **education** = the education group of the participant (imposed by author MC); primary (< 8 years), secondary (8-9 years), or preparatory (10+ years)
- **test.type** = parallel to `phase`, and indicates whether the test pair is for segmentation or generalization; SEG (segmentation) or GEN (generalization)
- **competitor.type** = parallel to `experiment`, and indicates what types of competitors are being used in the test item pairs; part-word (real/rule words vs. part words) or phantom-word (real/rule words vs. phantom words)
