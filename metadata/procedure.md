# NADL Procedure

We had two assistants. Both participated in collecting participants and running experiments. I would lead the experiment by speaking in English, pausing after one or two sentences so that the assistant could translate into Rossel.

We tried to collect data at a table in our hut with the door and windows closed to minimize distractions. On one day (about eight participants) we had to test  outside at a table under the eave of a hut; we sat with the participant facing the hut. On anther occasion we tested in another village (about 5 participants), where we set up in a host kitchen; we sat on the floor with the door and windows closed, but there were a lot of people milling around outside and a number of interruptions from children peeking in or crying for their mothers.

## Basic task description

- "You'll watch some videos. A few short ones and one long one. You'll answer some questions after each video."
- "The whole thing will take about 40 minutes."

## Consent

- We'll make a recording.
- We'll take it back to Holland.
- We'll share it with others like us who want to learn about Rossel language and people.
- We won't put your name with the recording.
- We won't sell any of the information.
- At the end, we'll give a small gift to thank you for your help.
- If you want to stop at *ANY* time, just say "stop" or "muntoo", and we'll stop. No problem at all.
- Is it okay if we make this recording?

## Metadata

- English and Rossel name
  - Rossel people generally go by a single given name within the Rossel community, but they're also given an English name that they use in contact off the island (e.g., with vistors like us, when going to the mainland, and so on).
- Where do you reside
   - I.e., which village? Nearly everyone who participated was from a village within a 2 minute to 3 hour walk from where we were based.
- Mother tongues of your father?
  - The culture imposes that, generally, men inherit land surrounding the village where they're born and that women move to their husbands' villages. Since we collected data in one area on Rossel, the father is very likely to be a Rossel native who heard Rossel growing up.
- Mother tongues of your mother?
  - Because of the above, if one parent isn't going to be a native Rossel speaker (in the area where we collected data), it's likely to be the mother.
- What languages did you hear most growing up?
  - We only collected data from people who grew up hearing primarily the Rossel language.
- Highest grade in school?
  - On Rossel, school starts at grade 1 goes up to grade 10. People start and progress at different ages, and teachers decide whether to pass students on to the next grade.
  - Beyond grade 10, students must effectively be nominated by their teachers and pass exams to go to high school, which adds another two years. Students must leave the island to go to a high school. High school is encoded as an `H` in the participant metadata.
  - Instead of going to high school, some students go to vocational school, which adds another three years. Vocational school is less academic than high school. Vocational students learn a collection of trades or crafts such as cooking, hospitality, secretarial work, and so on. Vocational school is encoded as a `V` in the participant metadata.
- Your age?
  - Ages are approximate. Many Rossel people don't keep close track of their age.
- Sex?

In practice, most of this metadata was collected directly from the assistant while the participant was watching the long video or directly after failing training. The assistant would sometimes ask the participant when they weren't confident about something. Rossel is a small place where nearby communities imply close social connections, and consequently the assistant was personally familiar with most of the participants.

## Training

- Check headphone volume.
    - Set up tablet with headphone splitter and two pairs of headphones.
    - Lower volume to medium.
    - Ask participant to put on headphones. Put on your own headphones.
    - Play NADL-set-volume (a recording of someone reading an English story, with volume normalized to match the volume of the stimuli).
    - Adjust volume up until the participant indicates that they can clearly hear the person telling the story.
- Introduce video.
    - On training tablet, set up version 3 of the training task.
    - Enter participant name like T09v3a
    - "Now you'll watch a short video. Just listen and try to remember what you hear. The images aren't important. They're just there for you to look at while you listen."
- Play the video.
- Introduce questions.
    - "You hear what this sounds like? I want you to remember it. I'll play it again in a minute."
    - "When the video ends, you'll hear two sounds. One of the sounds is just like the video. The other sound is different."
    - "You have to remember what you hear in the video so you can tell me which sound is like the video."
- Press "Press to see a test trial" to begin (you also wear headphones).
    - Help participant select 1 or 2 after listening to the sounds.
    - If they got it wrong:
        - "Sorry, that was the wrong one. We'll watch the video and try again."
    - Go through two correct trials.
    - If they don't get two right, start over with the first practice video. Set participant name like T09v3b.
    - End the experiment after 2–3 failed iterations (watch video, fail to get two practice trials right).
- Repeat video introduction, video with version 1 of the training task.
    - Enter participant name like T09v1a.
    - "We'll do it again with a new video."
- Introduce questions for V1.
    - "Just like before, you hear two sounds. You pick the sound like the video"
    - Use the same pass/fail procedure.

In practice, we sometimes jumped back and forth between the two practice versions and sometimes didn't give up until 4–6 failed iterations. For example, a practice sequence with failures followed by passing might look like V3 (fail), V3 (fail), V1 (pass), V3 (pass), continue with testing. A practice session with many failures might look like V3 (fail), V3 (fail), V1 (fail), V1 (fail), V1 (fail), V3 (fail), end experiment.

## Testing

- Check headphone volume on testing tablet (a separate tablet). Use same procedure as before.
- Introduce video.
    - "We're gonna do the same thing, but this time it's a long video."
    - XXX = Namuwâki
    - "This video has words from a new language, XXX. XXX sounds like Rossel, but it's not Rossel or any other language you might have heard. We made it up, so the words don't mean anything in Rossel."
    - "When the video ends, I'll ask you more questions, just like before. We won't say anything like 'that's right' this time. We'll just go on to the next question."
- Play the video.
- Introduce questions.
    - "Same as before."
- Thank them and give them a gift.
